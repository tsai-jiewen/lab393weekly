# How to creat docs on readthedocs?

You can follow the [offical getting started tutorial doc](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-mkdocs.html).
However you can creat a repo and files directly but not through the regular steps of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/).

## 1. Creat a repo and files

Follow this structure,
```
mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
docs/
    index.md  # The documentation homepage.
    readthedocs.yaml  # ??
    requirements.txt  # the required packages
    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
```
